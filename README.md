# Machine-Learning-Portfolio
A group of tasks demonstrating my understanding of Machine Learning. Futher descriptions of the coding tasks are in the notebooks or on README pages as necessary. The notebook files are Jupyter Notebooks, and the relevent files end in '.ipynb'. Other files in the folder are either README.md files, images used in the notebooks or the data sources/ models. The requirements of this task was to select a combination of portfolio items which total to 30 points.

### Task One (5 Points) GitHub Repo
Setting up GitHub Repo, complete with an organised file structure, and a README.md page with all necessary information (Project name and description, 
dates and references). This task is compulsory for the completion of the other tasks. Set up on July 28, added to until August 20.

### Task Two (5 Points) Grade Predictor
This task demonstrates my understanding of Supervised Learning using Linear Regression. It can be found in the folder named 'SuperisedLearning_LinearReggression'. Completed on August 2.

### Task Three (5 Points) Diabetes Prediction
Task three involves the use of K-NN algorithm used in a supervised learning environment, and it is found in the folder named 'SupervisedLearning_K-NN'. Completed on August 7.

### Task Four (5 Points) K-Means Clustering
This task shows my understanding of the K-Means Clustering method, which is completed in an unsupervised learning environment. It can be found in the folder named 'UnsupervisedLearning_Clustering'. Completed on August 11.

### Task Five (10 Points) Essay
For task 5, I chose to write an essay with the title 'Privacy In the Age of AI: Navigating the Ethical Dimensions of Machine Learning'. My essay can be found in the file with the name 'PrivacyInTheAgeOfAIEssay.md'. Started on August 13, Finalised on August 20.
