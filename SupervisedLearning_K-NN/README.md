# K-NN
K-Nearest Neigbours is a supervised learning technique in machine learning used for classification and regression tasks. In K-NN, a data point's class or value is determined by the majority class or average value of its k nearest neighbors in the feature space. The algorithm calculates the distance between the data point and its neighbors, often using Euclidean distance, and assigns the point to the class or value that is most common among its k closest neighbors. K-NN's performance can be influenced by the choice of k and the distance metric, and it's important to preprocess data to normalize scales.

# Diabetes Prediction
This model uses the K-NN technique to predict if the people sampled have diabetes. It is completed in a supervised learning environment, which means that the outcome is known and can be compared to the prediction. By doing this, we can see that the model for diabetes prediction based on factors such as blood suger, BMI, blood pressure and skin thickness is reasonable accurate, however still has a rate of error.
