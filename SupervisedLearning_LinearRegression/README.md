# Linear Regression
Linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm for machine learning, involving the linear method. It makes use of the gradient of a line of best fit for a dataset to predict where the next point may lie. To use this method, at least one value (x and y on a graph) must be known so that it can be substituted into an equation to find the other variable.

# Grade Predictor
This specific model predicts the grade that students will get on their 3rd assessment, based on factors such as their past 2 assessments, absences and living situations. It is a supervised learning environment because the 3rd assessment result is known and in the database, however it is removed from the calculations and compared to the prediction, providing an accuracy score.
